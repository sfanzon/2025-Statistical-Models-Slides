# Part 1: <br>Functions in R {background-color="#cc0164" visibility="uncounted"}

::: footer

<div color="#cc0164">  </div>

:::



## Expressions and objects {.smaller}

- Basic way to interact with R is through **expression evaluation**:
  * You enter an epression
  * The system evaluates it and prints the result

- Expressions work on **objects**
- **Object**: anything that can be assigned to a variable
- Objects encountered so far are:
  * Scalars
  * Vectors



## Functions and arguments {.smaller}

- **Functions** are a class of objects

- Format of a function is **name** followed by parentheses containing **arguments**

- Functions take **arguments** and **return** a result

- We already encountered several built in functions:
  * ``plot(x, y)``
  * ``lines(x, y)``
  * ``seq(x)``
  * ``print("Stats is great!")``
  * ``cat("R is great!")``
  * ``mean(x)``
  * ``sin(x)``


## Functions and arguments {.smaller}

- Functions have **actual arguments** and **formal arguments**
- Example: 
  * ``plot(x, y)`` has formal arguments two vectors ``x`` and ``y``
  * ``plot(height, weight)`` has actual arguments ``height`` and ``weight``

- When you write ``plot(height, weight)`` the arguments are matched:
  * ``height`` corresponds to x-variable
  * ``weight`` corresponds to y-variable
  * This is called **positional matching**
  
  

## Functions and arguments {.smaller}

- If a function has a lot of arguments, positional matching is tedious

- For example ``plot()`` accepts the following (and more!) arguments

| Argument |                        Description    |
|:--------:|:-------------------------------------:|
| ``x``    | x coordinate of points in the plot    |
| ``y``    | y coordinate of points in the plot    |
| ``type`` | Type of plot to be drawn              |
| ``main`` | Title of the plot                     |
| ``xlab`` | Label of x axis                       |
| ``ylab`` | Label of y axis                       | 
| ``pch``  | Shape of points                       |





## Functions and arguments {.smaller}

Issue with having too many arguments is the following:

- We might want to specify ``pch = 2``
- But then we would have to match all the arguments preceding
``pch``
  * ``x``
  * ``y``
  * ``type``
  * ``xlab``
  * ``ylab``



## Functions and arguments {.smaller}

- Thankfully we can use **named actual arguments**:
  * The name of a formal argument can be matched to an actual argument
  * This is independent of position

- For example we can specify ``pch = 2`` by the call
  * ``plot(weight, height, pch = 2)``

- In the above:
  * ``weight`` is implicitly matched to ``x``
  * ``height`` is implicitly matched to ``y``
  * ``pch`` is explicitly matched to ``2``
  
- Note that the following call would give same output
  * ``plot(x = weight, y = height, pch = 2)``






## Functions and arguments {.smaller}

- Named actual arguments **override** positional arguments
- Example: The following commands yield the same plot
  * ``plot(height, weight)``
  * ``plot(x = height, y = weight)``
  * ``plot(y = weight, x = height)``





## Functions and arguments {.smaller}

We have already seen another example of **named actual arguments**

- ``seq(from = 1, to = 11, by = 2)``
- ``seq(1, 11, 2)``
- These yield the same output. Why?
- Because in this case **named actual arguments** match **positional arguments**




## Functions and arguments {.smaller}

If however we want to divide the interval $[1, 11]$ in $5$ equal parts:

- Have to use ``seq(1, 11, length.out = 6)``


```{r}
#| echo: true
seq(1, 11, length.out = 6)
```

- The above is different from ``seq(1, 11, 6)``
```{r}
#| echo: true
seq(1, 11, 6)
```

- They are different because:
  * The 3rd positional argument of ``seq()`` is ``by``
  * Hence the command ``seq(1, 11, 6)`` assumes that ``by = 6``



## Functions and arguments {.smaller}
### Warning

- You can call functions without specifying arguments
- However you have to use brackets ``()``
- Example:
  * ``getwd()`` -- which outputs current working directory
  * ``ls()`` -- which outputs names of objects currently in memory




## Custom functions {.smaller}

- You can define your own functions in R
- Syntax for definining custom function ``my_function`` is below
- You can call your custom function by typing
    * ``my_function(arguments)``

```r
my_function <- function(first = "1st argument", 
                        ... ,
                        nth = "n-th argument") {
  
  # Code here: This is where you tell the function what to do

  return(object)      # Object to be returned  
}
```


## Custom functions -- Example {.smaller}

- The R function ``mean(x)`` computes the sample mean of vector ``x``
- We want to define our own function to compute the mean

- **Example:** The mean of ``x`` could be computed via
    * ``sum(x) / length(x)``
- We want to implement this code into the function ``my_mean(x)``
    * ``my_mean`` takes vector ``x`` as argument
    * ``my_mean`` returns a scalar -- the mean of ``x``

```r
# Definition of custom function my_mean(x)
my_mean <- function(vector = x) {
  
  mean_of_x <- sum(x) / length(x)
  
  return(mean_of_x)  
}
```



## Custom functions -- Example {.smaller}


- Let us use our function ``my_mean`` on an example

```r
# Generate a random vector of 1000 entries from N(0,1)
x <- rnorm(1000)

# Compute mean of x with my_mean
xbar <- my_mean(x)

# Compute mean of x with built in function mean
xbar_check <- mean(x)
  
cat("Mean of x computed with my_mean is:", xbar)
cat("Mean of x computed with R mean is:", xbar_check)
cat("They coincide!")
```

```{r}
my_mean <- function(vector = x) {
  
  mean_of_x <- sum(x) / length(x)
  
  return(mean_of_x)  
}

# Generate a random vector of 1000 entries from N(0,1)
x <- rnorm(1000)

# Compute mean of x with my_mean
xbar <- my_mean(x)

# Compute mean of x with built in function mean
xbar_check <- mean(x)
  
cat("Mean of x computed with my_mean is:", xbar)
cat("Mean of x computed with R mean is:", xbar_check)
cat("They coincide!")
```




# Part 2: <br>More on Vectors {background-color="#cc0164" visibility="uncounted"}

<div color="#cc0164">  </div>

## More on vectors {.smaller}

- We have seen vectors of numbers
- Further type of vectors are:
  * Character vectors
  * Logical vectors


## Character vectors {.smaller}

- A character vector is a vector of text strings
- Elements are specified and printed in quotes

```{r}
#| echo: true
x <- c("Red", "Green", "Blue")
print(x)
```

- You can use single- or double-quote symbols to specify strings
- This is as long as the left quote is the same as the right quote

```{r}
#| echo: true
x <- c('Red', 'Green', 'Blue')
print(x)
```



## Character vectors {.smaller}

``Print`` and ``cat`` produce different output on character vectors:

- ``print(x)`` prints all the strings in ``x`` separately
- ``cat(x)`` concatenates strings. There is no way to tell how many were there


::: {.column width="45%"}

```r
x <- c("Red", "Green", "Blue")
print(x)
cat(x)
```

```{r}
x <- c("Red", "Green", "Blue")
print(x)
cat(x)
```

:::



::: {.column width="45%"}

```r
y <- c("Red Green", "Blue")
print(y)
cat(y)
```

```{r}
y <- c("Red Green", "Blue")
print(y)
cat(y)
```

:::


## Logical vectors {.smaller}

- Logical vectors can take the values ``TRUE``, ``FALSE`` or ``NA``
- ``TRUE`` and ``FALSE`` can be abbreviated with ``T`` and ``F``
- ``NA`` stands for **not available**

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Create logical vector
x <- c(T, T, F, T, NA)

# Print the logical vector
print(x)
```


## Logical vectors {.smaller}

- Logical vectors are extremely useful to evaluate conditions

- Example:
  * given a numerical vector ``x``
  * we want to count how many entries are above a value ``t``


```r
# Generate a vector containing sequence 1 to 8
x <- seq(from = 1 , to = 8, by = 1)

# Generate vector of flags for entries strictly above 5
y <- ( x > 5 )

cat("Vector x is: (", x, ")")
cat("Entries above 5 are: (", y, ")")
```


```{r}
# Generate a vector containing sequence 1 to 8
x <- seq(from = 1 , to = 8, by = 1)

# Generate vector of flags for entries strictly above 5
y <- ( x > 5 )

cat("Vector x is: (", x, ")")
cat("Entries above 5 are: (", y, ")")
```



## Logical vectors -- Application {.smaller}

- Generate a vector of 1000 numbers from $N(0,1)$
- Count how many entries are above the mean $0$
- Since there are many (1000) entries, we expect a result close to 500
    * This is because *sample mean* converges to *true mean* $0$

**Question**: How to do this?

**Hint**: ``T/F`` are interpreted as ``1/0`` in arithmetic operations


::: {.column width="45%"}
```{r}
#| echo: true
T + T
T + F
```

:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
```{r}
#| echo: true
F + F
F + T + 3
```

:::



## Logical vectors -- Application {.smaller}

- The function ``sum(x)`` sums the entries of a vector ``x``
- We can use ``sum(x)`` to count the number of ``T`` entries in a logical vector ``x``



```r
x <- rnorm(1000)       # Generates vector with 1000 normal entries

y <- (x > 0)           # Generates logical vector of entries above 0

above_zero <- sum(y)   # Counts entries above zero

cat("Number of entries which are above the average 0 is", above_zero)
cat("This is pretty close to 500!")
```


```{r}
# Generate vector with 1000 normal entries
x <- rnorm(1000)

# Generate logical vector of entries above 0
y <- (x > 0)

# Count entries above zero
above_zero <- sum(y)

cat("Number of entries which are above the average 0 is", above_zero)
cat("This is pretty close to 500!")
```



## Missing values {.smaller}

- In practical data analysis, a data point is frequently unavailable
- Statistical software needs ways to deal with this
- R allows vectors to contain a special ``NA`` value - Not Available
- ``NA`` is carried through in computations: operations on ``NA`` yield ``NA`` as the result


```{r}
#| echo: true

2 * NA
NA + NA
T + NA
```




## Indexing vectors {.smaller}

- Components of a vector can be retrieved by **indexing**

- ``vector[k]`` returns k-th component of ``vector``

<br>

```{r}
#| echo: true

vector <- c("Cat", "Dog", "Mouse")

second_element <- vector[2]           # Access 2nd entry of vector

print(second_element)
```




## Replacing vector elements {.smaller}

To modify an element of a vector use the following:

- ``vector[k] <- value`` stores ``value`` in k-th component of ``vector``

<br>

```{r}
#| echo: true

vector <- c("Cat", "Dog", "Mouse")

# We replace 2nd entry of vector with string "Horse"
vector[2] <- "Horse"

print(vector)
```




## Vector slicing {.smaller}

Returning multiple items of a vactor is known as **slicing**

- ``vector[c(k1, ..., kn)]`` returns components ``k1, ..., kn``
- ``vector[k1:k2]`` returns components ``k1`` to ``k2``

```{r}
#| echo: true

vector <- c(11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 100)

# We store 1st, 3rd, 5th entries of vector in slice
slice <- vector[c(1, 3, 5)]   

print(slice)

```


## Vector slicing {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true

vector <- c(11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 100)

# We store 2nd to 7th entries of vector in slice
slice <- vector[2:7]

print(slice)
```



## Deleting vector elements {.smaller}

- Elements of a vector ``x`` can be deleted by using
    * ``x[ -c(k1, ..., kn) ]`` which deletes entries ``k1, ..., kn``
    
```r
# Create a vector x
x <- c(11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 100)

# Print vector x
cat("Vector x is:", x)

# Delete 2nd, 3rd and 7th entries of x
x <- x[ -c(2, 3, 7) ]

# Print x again
cat("Vector x with 2nd, 3rd and 7th entries removed:", x)
```


```{r}
# Create a vector x
x <- c(11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 100)

# Print vector x
cat("Vector x is:", x)

# Delete 2nd, 3rd and 7th entries of x
x <- x[ -c(2, 3, 7) ]

# Print x again
cat("Vector x with 2nd, 3rd and 7th entries removed:", x)
```



## Logical Subsetting {.smaller}


- You can index or slice vectors by entering explicit indices
- You can also index vectors, or **subset**, by using **logical flag vectors**:
    * Element is extracted if corresponding entry in the flag vector is TRUE 
    * Logical flag vectors should be the same length as vector to subset

**Code**: Suppose given a vector ``x``

- Create a flag vector by using 
    * ``flag <- condition(x)``

- ``condition()`` is any function which returns ``T/F`` vector of same length as ``x``

- Subset ``x`` by using 
    * ``x[flag]``  




## Logical Subsetting {.smaller}
### Example

- The following code extracts negative components from a numeric vector
- This can be done by using
    * ``x[ x < 0 ]``

```r
# Create numeric vector x
x <- c(5, -2.3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 8, 10, 40221, -8)

# Get negative components from x and store them in neg_x
neg_x <- x[ x < 0 ]

cat("Vector x is:", x)
cat("Negative components of x are:", neg_x)
```


```{r} 
# Create numeric vector x
x <- c(5, -2.3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 8, 10, 40221, -8)

# Get negative components from x and store them in neg_x
neg_x <- x[ x < 0 ]

cat("Vector x is:", x)
cat("Negative components of x are:", neg_x)
```



## Logical Subsetting {.smaller}
### Example

- The following code extracts components falling between ``a`` and ``b``
- This can be done by using logical operator and ``&``
    * ``x[ (x > a) & (x < b) ]``

```r
# Create numeric vector
x <- c(5, -2.3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 8, 10, 40221, -8)

# Get components between 0 and 100
range_x <- x[ (x > 0) & (x < 100) ]

cat("Vector x is:", x)
cat("Components of x between 0 and 100 are:", range_x)
```


```{r} 
# Create numeric vector
x <- c(5, -2.3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 8, 10, 40221, -8)

# Get components between 0 and 100
range_x <- x[ (x > 0) & (x < 100) ]

cat("Vector x is:", x)
cat("Components of x between 0 and 100 are:", range_x)
```



## The function Which {.smaller}

- ``which()`` allows to convert a logical vector ``flag`` into a numeric index vector 
    * ``which(flag)`` is vector of indices of ``flag`` which correspond to ``TRUE``


```r
# Create a logical flag vector
flag <- c(T, F, F, T, F)

# Indices for  flag which
true_flag <- which(flag)

cat("Flag vector is:", flag)
cat("Positions for which Flag is TRUE are:", true_flag)
```


```{r}
# Create a logical flag vector
flag <- c(T, F, F, T, F)

# Indices for  flag which
true_flag <- which(flag)

cat("Flag vector is:", flag)
cat("Positions for which Flag is TRUE are:", true_flag)
```



## The function Which -- Application {.smaller}

``which()`` can be used to delete certain entries from a vector ``x``

- Create a flag vector by using 
    * ``flag <- condition(x)``

- ``condition()`` is any function which returns ``T/F`` vector of same length as ``x``

- Delete entries flagged by ``condition`` using the code
    * ``x[ -which(flag) ]``




## The function Which -- Application {.smaller}
### Example

```r
# Create numeric vector x
x <- c(5, -2.3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 8, 10, 40221, -8)

# Print x
cat("Vector x is:", x)

# Flag positive components of x
flag_pos_x <- (x > 0)

# Remove positive components from x
 x <- x[ -which(flag_pos_x) ]

# Print x again
cat("Vector x with positive components removed:", x)
```


```{r} 
# Create numeric vector x
x <- c(5, -2.3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 8, 10, 40221, -8)

# Print x
cat("Vector x is:", x)

# Flag positive components of x
flag_pos_x <- (x > 0)

# Remove positive components from x
 x <- x[ -which(flag_pos_x) ]

# Print x again
cat("Vector x with positive components removed:", x)
```





## Functions that create vectors {.smaller}

The main functions to generate vectors are

- ``c()`` concatenate
- ``seq()`` sequence
- ``rep()`` replicate

We have already met ``c()`` and ``seq()`` but there are more details to discuss



## Concatenate {.smaller}

**Recall:** ``c()`` generates a vector containing the input values

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Generate a vector of values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Print the vector
print(x)
```


## Concatenate {.smaller}

- ``c()`` can also concatenate vectors 
- This was you can **add** entries to an **existing vector**

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Create 2 vectors
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(6, 7, 8)

# Concatenate vectors x and y, and also add element 9
z <- c(x, y, 9)

# Print the resulting vector
print(z)
```




## Concatenate {.smaller}


- You can assign names to vector elements

- This modiﬁes the way the vector is printed

```{r}
#| echo: true

# We specify a vector with 3 named entries
x <- c(first = "Red", second = "Green", third = "Blue")

# Print the named vector
print(x)
```


## Concatenate {.smaller}

Given a named vector ``x``

- Names can be extracted with ``names(x)``
- Values can be extracted with ``unname(x)``

```r
# Create named vector
x <- c(first = "Red", second = "Green", third = "Blue")

# Access names of x via names(x)
names_x <- names(x)

# Access values of x via unname(x)
values_x <- unname(x)

cat("Names of x are:", names(x))
cat("Values of x are:", unname(x))
```


```{r}
# Create named vector
x <- c(first = "Red", second = "Green", third = "Blue")

# Names of componenents of x are accessed via names(x)
names_x <- names(x)

# Values of componenents of x are accessed via unname(x)
values_x <- unname(x)

cat("Names of x are:", names(x))
cat("Values of x are:", unname(x))
```


## Concatenate {.smaller}

- All elements of a vector have the **same** type
- Concatenating vectors of different types leads to conversion


```{r}
#| echo: true

c(FALSE, 2)        # Converts FALSE to 0
```

<br>

```{r}
#| echo: true

c(pi, "stats")     # Converts pi to string 

```

<br>

```{r}
#| echo: true

c(TRUE, "stats")   # Converts TRUE to string
```



## Sequence {.smaller}

- Recall the syntax of ``seq`` is
  * ``seq(from =, to =, by =, length.out =)``

- Omitting the third argument assumes that ``by = 1``

```{r}
#| echo: true

# The following generates a vector of integers from 1 to 6
x <- seq(1, 6)

print(x)
```


## Sequence {.smaller}


- ``seq(x1, x2)`` is equivalent to ``x1:x2``
- Syntax ``x1:x2`` is **preferred** to ``seq(x1, x2)``


```r
# Generate two vectors of integers from 1 to 6
x <- seq(1, 6)
y <- 1:6

cat("Vector x is:", x)
cat("Vector y is:", y)
cat("They are the same!")
```


```{r}
# Generate two vectors of integers from 1 to 6
x <- seq(1, 6)
y <- 1:6

cat("Vector x is:", x)
cat("Vector y is:", y)
cat("They are the same!")
```






## Replicate {.smaller}

``rep`` generates repeated values from a vector:

- ``x`` vector 
- ``n`` integer
- ``rep(x, n)`` repeats ``n`` times the vector ``x``

```r
# Create a vector with 3 components
x <- c(2, 1, 3)

# Repeats 4 times the vector x
y <- rep(x, 4)

cat("Original vector is:", x)
cat("Original vector repeated 4 times:", y)
```

```{r}
# Create a vector with 3 components
x <- c(2, 1, 3)

# Repeats 4 times the vector x
y <- rep(x, 4)

cat("Original vector is:", x)
cat("Original vector repeated 4 times:", y)
```
  

## Replicate {.smaller}


The second argument of ``rep()`` can also be a vector:

- Given ``x`` and ``y`` vectors
- ``rep(x, y)`` repeats entries of ``x`` as many times as corresponding entries of ``y``


```r
x <- c(2, 1, 3)         # Vector to replicate
y <- c(1, 2, 3)         # Vector saying how to replicate 

z <- rep(x, y)          # 1st entry of x is replicated 1 time
                        # 2nd entry of x is replicated 2 times
                        # 3rd entry of x is replicated 3 times

cat("Original vector is:", x)
cat("Original vector repeated is:", z)
```


```{r}
x <- c(2, 1, 3)         # Vector to replicate
y <- c(1, 2, 3)         # Vector saying how to replicate 

z <- rep(x, y)          # 1st entry of x is replicated 1 time
                        # 2nd entry of x is replicated 2 times
                        # 3rd entry of x is replicated 3 times

cat("Original vector is:", x)
cat("Original vector repeated is:", z)
```

## Replicate {.smaller}

- ``rep()`` can be useful to create vectors of labels
- **Example**: Suppose we want to collect some numeric data on 3 Cats and 4 Dogs


```{r}
#| echo: true

x <- c("Cat", "Dog")     # Vector to replicate

y <- rep(x, c(3, 4))     # 1st entry of x is replicated 3 times
                         # 2nd entry of x is replicated 4 times

cat("Vector of labels is:", y)
```





# Part 3: <br>Lists {background-color="#cc0164" visibility="uncounted"}

::: footer

<div color="#cc0164">  </div>

:::



## Lists {.smaller}


- Vectors can contain only one data type (number, character, boolean)

- Lists are data structures that can contain **any R object**

- Lists can be created similarly to vectors, with the command ``list()``

```{r}
#| echo: true

# List containing a number, a vector, and a string
my_list <- list(2, c(T,F,T,T), "hello")

# Print the list
print(my_list)
```




## Retrieving elements {.smaller}

Elements of a list can be retrieved by **indexing**

- ``my_list[[k]]`` returns k-th element of ``my_list``

<br>

```{r}
#| echo: true
# Consider again the same list
my_list <- list(2, c(T,F,T,T), "hello")

# Access 2nd element of my_list and store it in variable
second_element <- my_list[[2]]

# In this case the variable second_element is a vector
print(second_element)

```



## List slicing {.smaller}


You can return multiple items of a list via **slicing**

- ``my_list[c(k1, ..., kn)]`` returns elements in positions ``k1, ..., kn``
- ``my_list[k1:k2]`` returns elements ``k1`` to ``k2``

```{r}
#| echo: true

my_list <- list(2, c(T,F), "Cat", "Dog", pi, 42)

# We store 1st, 3rd, 5th entries of my_list in slice
slice <- my_list[c(1, 3, 5)]

print(slice)

```


## List slicing {.smaller}


```{r}
#| echo: true

my_list <- list(2, c(T,F), "Cat", "Dog", pi, 42)

# We store 2nd to 4th entries of my_list in slice
slice <- my_list[2:4]

print(slice)

```


## Naming {.smaller}

- Components of a list can be **named**. Names can be assigned with
    * ``names(my_list) <- c("name_1", ..., "name_k")``

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Create list with 3 elements
my_list <- list(2, c(T,F,T,T), "hello")

# Name each of the 3 elements
names(my_list) <- c("number", "TF_vector", "string")

# Print the named list: the list is printed along with element names 
print(my_list)

```



## Accessing a name {.smaller}

- A component of ``my_list`` named ``my_name`` can be accessed with dollar operator
    * ``my_list$my_name``

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Create list with 3 elements and name them
my_list <- list(2, c(T,F,T,T), "hello")
names(my_list) <- c("number", "TF_vector", "string")

# Access 2nd element using dollar operator and store it in variable
second_component <- my_list$TF_vector

# Print 2nd element
print(second_component)

```

## Data Frames {.smaller}

- Data Frames are the best way of presenting a data set in R:
    * Each variable has assigned a collection of recorded observations

- Data frames can contain any R object

- Data Frames are similar to Lists, with the difference that:
    * Members of a Data Frame must all be vectors of equal length





## Constructing a Data Frame {.smaller}

- Data frames are constructed similarly to lists, using ``data.frame()``

- **Important**: Elements of data frame must be vectors of the same length

- **Example**: We construct the **Family Guy** data frame. Variables are
    * ``person`` -- Name of character
    * ``age`` -- Age of character
    * ``sex`` -- Sex of character

```r
family <- data.frame(
  person = c("Peter", "Lois", "Meg", "Chris", "Stewie"),
  age = c(42, 40, 17, 14, 1),
  sex = c("M", "F" , "F", "M", "M")
)
```



## Printing a Data Frame {.smaller}

::: {.column width="44%"}

- R prints data frames like matrices
- First row contains vector names

:::

::: {.column width="54%"}

- First column contains row names
- Data are paired: e.g. Peter is 42 and Male

:::

```{r}
#| echo: true

family <- data.frame(
  person = c("Peter", "Lois", "Meg", "Chris", "Stewie"),
  age = c(42, 40, 17, 14, 1),
  sex = c("M", "F" , "F", "M", "M")
)

print(family)

```


## Extracting data {.smaller}

- Think of a data frame as a *matrix*

- You can extract element in position ``(m,n)`` by using
    * ``my_data[m, n]``

- **Example**: Peter is in 1st row. We can extract Peter's name as follows


```r
extracted <- family[1, 1]

print(extracted)
```

```{r}
family <- data.frame(
  person = c("Peter", "Lois", "Meg", "Chris", "Stewie"),
  age = c(42, 40, 17, 14, 1),
  sex = c("M", "F" , "F", "M", "M")
)

extracted <- family[1, 1]

print(extracted)
```




## Extracting data {.smaller}

To extract multiple elements on the same row or column type

- ``my_data[c(k1,...,kn), m] `` $\quad$ or $\quad$ `` my_data[k1:k2, m]``
- ``my_data[n, c(k1,...,km)] `` $\quad$ or $\quad$ `` my_data[n, k1:k2]``

**Example**: Meg is listed in 3rd row. We extract her *age* and *sex*


```r
meg_data <- family[3, 2:3]

print(meg_data)
```

```{r}
family <- data.frame(
  person = c("Peter", "Lois", "Meg", "Chris", "Stewie"),
  age = c(42, 40, 17, 14, 1),
  sex = c("M", "F" , "F", "M", "M")
)

meg_data <- family[3, 2:3]

print(meg_data)
```



## Extracting data {.smaller}

To extract entire rows or columns type

- ``my_data[c(k1,...,kn), ] `` $\quad$ or $\quad$ `` my_data[k1:k2, ]``
- ``my_data[, c(k1,...,km)] `` $\quad$ or $\quad$ `` my_data[, k1:k2]``


```r
peter_data <- family[1, ]      # Extracts first row - Peter
sex_age <- family[, c(3,2)]    # Extracts third and second columns:
                               # sex and age

print(peter_data)
print(sex_age)
```

```{r}

family <- data.frame(
  person = c("Peter", "Lois", "Meg", "Chris", "Stewie"),
  age = c(42, 40, 17, 14, 1),
  sex = c("M", "F" , "F", "M", "M")
)

peter_data <- family[1, ]
sex_age <- family[, c(3,2)]

print(peter_data)
print(sex_age)

```



## Extracting data {.smaller}

Use dollar operator to access data frame columns

- Suppose data set ``my_data`` contains a variable called ``my_variable``
- ``my_data$my_variable`` accesses column ``my_variable``
- ``my_data$my_variable`` is a vector

**Example**: To access *age* in the ``family`` data frame type

```r
ages <- family$age        # Stores ages in a vector

cat("Ages of the Family Guy characters are", ages)
cat("Meg's age is", ages[3])
```

```{r}
family <- data.frame(
  person = c("Peter", "Lois", "Meg", "Chris", "Stewie"),
  age = c(42, 40, 17, 14, 1),
  sex = c("M", "F" , "F", "M", "M")
)

ages <- family$age

cat("Ages of the Family Guy characters are", ages)
cat("Meg's age is", ages[3])
```




## Size of a data frame {.smaller}

The size of a data frame can be discovered using:

- ``nrow(my_data)`` $\quad$ number of rows
- ``ncol(my_data)`` $\quad$ number of columns
- ``dim(my_data)`` $\quad \quad$ vector containing number of rows and columns


```r
family_dim <- dim(family)    # Stores dimensions of family in a vector

cat("The Family Guy data frame has", family_dim[1], 
    "rows and", family_dim[2], "columns")
```

```{r}
family <- data.frame(
  person = c("Peter", "Lois", "Meg", "Chris", "Stewie"),
  age = c(42, 40, 17, 14, 1),
  sex = c("M", "F" , "F", "M", "M")
)

family_dim <- dim(family)

cat("The Family Guy data frame has", family_dim[1], 
    "rows and", family_dim[2], "columns")

```




## Adding Data {.smaller}


Adding data to an existing data frame ``my_data``

- Add more records (adding to rows) 
    * Create single row data frame ``new_record``
    * ``new_record`` must match the structure of ``my_data``
    * Add to ``my_data`` with ``my_data <- rbind(my_data, new_record)``

- Add a set of observations for a new variable (adding to columns)
    * Create a vector ``new_variable``
    * ``new_variable`` must have as many components as rows in ``my_data``
    * Add to ``my_data`` with ``my_data <- cbind(my_data, new_variable)``

    

## Example: Add new record {.smaller}

- Consider the usual **Family Guy** data frame ``family``
- Suppose we want to add data for **Brian**
- Create a new record: a single row data frame with columns   
    * *person*, *age*, *sex*

```{r}
#| echo: true

new_record <- data.frame(
  person = "Brian",
  age = 7,
  sex = "M"
)

print(new_record)
```




## Example: Add new record {.smaller}


- Now we add ``new_record`` to ``family``

```r
family <- rbind(family, new_record)

print(family)
```

```{r}
family <- data.frame(
  person = c("Peter", "Lois", "Meg", "Chris", "Stewie"),
  age = c(42, 40, 17, 14, 1),
  sex = c("M", "F" , "F", "M", "M")
)

new_record <- data.frame(
  person = "Brian",
  age = 7,
  sex = "M"
)

family <- rbind(family, new_record)
print(family)
```



## Example: Add new variable {.smaller}

- We want to add a new variable to the **Family Guy** data frame ``family``
- This variable is called ``funny``
- It records how funny each character is, with levels
    * *Low*, *Med*, *High*
- Create a vector ``funny`` with entries matching each character (including **Brian**)


```{r}
#| echo: true

funny <- c("High", "High", "Low", "Med", "High", "Med")

print(funny)

```


## Example: Add new variable {.smaller}

- Add ``funny`` to the **Family Guy** data frame ``family``



```r
family <- cbind(family, funny)

print(family)
```


```{r}
family <- data.frame(
  person = c("Peter", "Lois", "Meg", "Chris", "Stewie"),
  age = c(42, 40, 17, 14, 1),
  sex = c("M", "F" , "F", "M", "M")
)

new_record <- data.frame(
  person = "Brian",
  age = 7,
  sex = "M"
)

family <- rbind(family, new_record)

funny <- c("High", "High", "Low", "Med", "High", "Med")

family <- cbind(family, funny)
print(family)
```



## Adding a new variable: alternative way {.smaller}

Instead of using ``cbind`` we can add a new varibale using dollar operator:

- We want to add a variable called ``new_variable``
- Create a vector ``v`` containing values for the new variable
- ``v`` must have as many components as rows in ``my_data``
- Add to ``my_data`` with ``my_data$new_variable <- v``
    



## Adding a new variable: alternative way {.smaller}

**Example**: 

- We add age expressed in months to the **Family Guy** data frame ``family``
- Age in months can be computed by multiplying vector ``family$age`` by $12$


```r
v <- family$age * 12       # Computes vector of ages in months

family$age.months <- v     # Stores vector as new column in family

print(family)
```


```{r}
family <- data.frame(
  person = c("Peter", "Lois", "Meg", "Chris", "Stewie"),
  age = c(42, 40, 17, 14, 1),
  sex = c("M", "F" , "F", "M", "M")
)

new_record <- data.frame(
  person = "Brian",
  age = 7,
  sex = "M"
)

family <- rbind(family, new_record)

funny <- c("High", "High", "Low", "Med", "High", "Med")

family <- cbind(family, funny)

v <- family$age * 12
family$age.months <- v
print(family)
```




## Logical Record Subsets {.smaller}

- We saw how to use **logical flag vectors** to subset vectors

- We can use logical flag vectors to subset data frames as well

- Suppose to have data frame ``my_data`` containing a variable ``my_variable``

- Want to subset records in ``my_data`` for which  ``my_variable`` satisfies a condition

- Use commands
    * ``flag <- condition(my_data$my_variable)``
    * ``my_data[flag, ]``
 



## Logical Record Subsets {.smaller}

**Example**:

- Consider again the **Family Guy** data frame ``family``
- We subset Male characters using flag ``family$sex == "M"``



```r
# Create flag vector for male Family Guy characters
flag <- (family$sex == "M")

# Subset data frame "family" and store in data frame "subset"
subset <- family[flag, ]

# Print subset
print(subset)
```

```{r}
family <- data.frame(
  person = c("Peter", "Lois", "Meg", "Chris", "Stewie"),
  age = c(42, 40, 17, 14, 1),
  sex = c("M", "F" , "F", "M", "M")
)

new_record <- data.frame(
  person = "Brian",
  age = 7,
  sex = "M"
)

family <- rbind(family, new_record)

funny <- c("High", "High", "Low", "Med", "High", "Med")

family <- cbind(family, funny)

family$age.months <- family$age * 12

flag <- (family$sex == "M")
subset <- family[flag, ]
print(subset)
```

::: footer

<div color="#cc0164">  </div>

:::



## Reading data from files {.smaller}

- R has a many functions for reading **characters** from stored **files** 

- We will see how to read **Table-Format** files

- **Table-Formats** are just tables stored in plain-text files

- Typical file estensions are:
    * ``.txt`` for plain-text files
    * ``.csv`` for comma-separated values


- **Table-Formats** can be read into R with the command
    * ``read.table()``




## Table-Formats {.smaller}
### 4 key features
    
1. **Header**: 
    * If present, header should be the first line of the file
    * Header is used to provide names for each column of data
    * If a header is present, you need to tell this to R when importing
    * If not, R cannot tell if first line is a header or observed data values




## Table-Formats {.smaller}
### 4 key features

2. **Delimiter**: 
    * A character used to separate the entries in each line
    * Delimiter character cannot be used for anything else in the file
    * Delimiter tells R when a specific entry begins and ends
    * Default delimiter is **whitespace**



## Table-Formats {.smaller}
### 4 key features

3. **Missing value**: 
    * Character string used exclusively to denote a missing value
    * When reading the file, R will turn these entries into ``NA``



## Table-Formats {.smaller}
### 4 key features

4. **Comments**:
    * Table files can include comments
    * Comment lines start with $\quad$ ``#``
    * R ignores such comments




## Table-Formats {.smaller}
### Example

- Table-Format for **Family Guy** characters can be downloaded here [family_guy.txt](datasets/family_guy.txt)


::: {.column width="54%"}

- The text file looks like this

![](images/family_guy.png){width=78%}

:::

::: {.column width="44%"}

- Remarks:
    * Header is present
    * Delimiter is **whitespace**
    * Missing values denoted by ``*``

:::



## read.table command {.smaller}

- Table-Formats can be read via ``read.table()``
    * This reads a ``.txt`` or ``.csv`` file and outputs a data frame
- Options of ``read.table()``
    * ``header = T/F`` -- Tells R if a header is present
    * ``na.strings = "string"`` -- Tells R that ``"string"`` means ``NA``



## Reading our first Table-Format file {.smaller}

To read ``family_guy.txt`` into R proceed as follows:

1. Download [family_guy.txt](datasets/family_guy.txt) and move file to Desktop

2. Open the R Console and change working directory to **Desktop**

```r
# In MacOS type
setwd("~/Desktop")

# In Windows type
setwd("C:/Users/YourUsername/Desktop")
```


## Reading our first Table-Format file {.smaller}


3. Read ``family_guy.txt`` into R and store it in data frame ``family`` with code

```r
family = read.table(file = "family_guy.txt",
                    header = TRUE,
                    na.strings = "*"
                    )
```

4. Note that we are telling ``read.table()`` that
    * ``family_guy.txt`` has a header
    * Missing values are denoted by ``*``



## Reading our first Table-Format file {.smaller}


::: {.column width="48%"}
5. Print data frame ``family`` to screen

```r
print(family)
```

```{r}
family = read.table(file = "datasets/family_guy.txt",
                    header = TRUE,
                    na.strings = "*"
                    )
print(family)
```

:::

::: {.column width="48%"}

- For comparison this is the ``.txt`` file

![](images/family_guy.png){width=85%}

:::





## Application: t-test {.smaller}

**Example**: Analysis of Consumer Confidence Index for 2008 crisis from Lecture 4

- We imported data into R using ``c()``
- This is ok for small datasets
- Suppose the CCI data is stored in a ``.txt`` file instead


**Goal**: Perform t-test on CCI difference for mean difference $\mu = 0$

- By reading CCI data into R using ``read.table()``
- By manipulating CCI data using **data frames**




## Application: t-test {.smaller}

- The CCI dataset can be downloaded here [2008_crisis.txt](datasets/2008_crisis.txt)

- The text file looks like this

![](images/2008_crisis.png){width=78%}



## Application: t-test {.smaller}

To perform the t-test on data ``2008_crisis.txt`` we proceed as follows:

1. Download dataset [2008_crisis.txt](datasets/2008_crisis.txt) and move file to Desktop

2. Open the R Console and change working directory to **Desktop**

```r
# In MacOS type
setwd("~/Desktop")

# In Windows type
setwd("C:/Users/YourUsername/Desktop")
```

3. Read ``2008_crisis.txt`` into R and store it in data frame ``scores`` with code

```r
scores = read.table(file = "2008_crisis",
                    header = TRUE
                    )
```


## Application: t-test {.smaller}

4. Store 2nd and 3rd columns of ``scores`` into 2 vectors

```r
# CCI from 2007 is stored in 2nd column
score_2007 <- scores[, 2]

# CCI from 2009 is stored in 3nd column
score_2009 <- scores[, 3]
```


5. Now the t-test can be performed as done in Lecture 4

```r
# Compute vector of differences
difference <- score_2007 - score_2009

# Perform t-test on difference with null hypothesis mu = 0
t.test(difference, mu = 0)
```



## Application: t-test {.smaller}

6. We obtain the same result of Lecture 4
    * p-value is $p < 0.05$
    * Reject $H_0$: The mean difference is not $0$
    * In details, the output of ``t.test`` is below

- For convenience you can download the full code [2008_crisis_code.R](codes/2008_crisis_code.R)

```{r}
# Read ``2008_crisis.txt`` into R and store in "scores"
scores = read.table(file = "datasets/2008_crisis.txt",
                    header = TRUE
                    )

# Extract scores of 2007 and 2009 in 2 vectors
score_2007 <- scores[, 2]
score_2009 <- scores[, 3]

# Compute difference
difference <- score_2007 - score_2009

# Perform t-test on difference with null hypothesis mu = 0
t.test(difference, mu = 0)
```





# Part 6: <br>R Style Guide {background-color="#cc0164" visibility="uncounted"}

::: footer

<div color="#cc0164">  </div>

:::


## R Style Guide {.smaller}

- Styling your code is optional
- However it is considered good manners to do so
- Good coding style makes code more readable
- Highly recommended, especially for assignments
- The next few slides on Style are based on these two posts:
  * Style Guide by Hadley Wickham ([link](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html#:~:text=When%20indenting%20your%20code%2C%20use,definition%20runs%20over%20multiple%20lines.))
  * Google's R Style Guide ([link](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html))



## File names {.smaller}

They should be meaningful and end in .R

```r
# Good
football-models.R  
utility-functions.R
homework_1.R
homework1.R

# Bad
footballmodels.r # Hard to read
stuff.r          # What is inside this file?
code.r           # Same as above

```



## Objects names {.smaller}

- Objects names shoulde be lowercase
- Use an underscore (``_``) to separate words within a name
- Variable names should be nouns, not verbs
- Come up with names that are concise and meaningful

```r
# Good
day_one  # This will clearly store the value of first day
day_1    # Still clear


# Bad
first_day_of_the_month  # Too long
dayone                  # Hard to read
DayOne                  # Mix of upper and lower case
fdm                     # Hard to guess what this means
```




## Functions names {.smaller}

- Name functions with ``BigCamelCase`` ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case))
- This is to clearly distinguish functions from other objects
- Functions names should be verbs
- Come up with names that are concise and meaningful

```r
# Good
DoNothing <- function() {
  return(invisible(NULL))
}

# Bad
donothing <- function() {
  return(invisible(NULL))
}
```





## Object and functions names {.smaller}

If possible avoid using names of existing functions and variables


```r
# Bad
T <- FALSE                  # T is reserved for the boolean TRUE
c <- 10                     # c denotes the concatenation operator
mean <- function(x) sum(x)  # mean already denotes a built in function
```



## Assignment {.smaller}

Use ``<-`` and not ``=`` for assignment

```r 
# Good
x <- 5

# Bad
x = 5
```




## Spacing {.smaller}

- Spacing is **really** something you should be careful about
- Place spaces around all infix operators (``=``, ``+``, ``-``, ``<-``, etc.) 
- Place spaces around ``=`` when calling a function 
- Always put a space after a comma, never before (like in regular English)

```r 
# Good
average <- mean(feet / 12 + inches, na.rm = TRUE)

# Bad
average<-mean(feet/12+inches,na.rm=TRUE)
```




## Spacing with Brackets {.smaller}

- Do not place spaces around code in parentheses or square brackets
- Unless there is a comma

```r
# Good
if (condition) do(x)
diamonds[5, ]

# Bad
if ( condition ) do(x)  # No spaces around condition
x[1,]                   # Needs a space after the comma
x[1 ,]                  # Space goes after comma not before
```




## Spacing - Exceptions {.smaller}

- Symbols ``:``, ``::`` and ``:::`` do not need spacing

```r
# Good
x <- 1:10

# Bad
x <- 1 : 10
```

- Place a space before left parentheses, except in a function call

```r
#Good
if (condition) do(x)
plot(x, y)

# Bad
if(condition)do(x)    # (condition) needs spacing
plot (x, y)           # This does not need spacing
```



## Extra Spacing {.smaller}

Extra spacing is ok if it improves alignment of ``=`` or ``<-``

```r
list(
  total = a + b + c, 
  mean  = (a + b + c) / n
)
```



## Curly braces {.smaller}

- An opening curly brace should never go on its own line 
- An opening curly brace should always be followed by a new line
- Always **indent** the code inside curly braces


::: {.column width="45%"}

```r
# Good

if (y < 0 && debug) {
  message("Y is negative")
}

if (y == 0) {
  log(x)
} 
```

:::


::: {.column width="45%"}

```r
# Bad

if (y < 0 && debug)
message("Y is negative")


if (y == 0) 
{
  log(x)} 
```

:::





## Line length {.smaller}

- Limit code to 80 characters per line
- This fits comfortably on a printed page 
- If you run out of room, encapsulate some of the work in separate function




## Indentation {.smaller}

- When indenting your code, use two spaces
- Never use tabs or mix tabs and spaces
- Indentation should be used for **functions**, **if**, **for**, etc.

```r
SumTwoNumbers <- function(x, y) {
  s = x + y
  return(s)
}
```



## Indentation - Exception {.smaller}

If a function definition runs over multiple lines, indent the second line to where the definition starts

```r
long_function_name <- function(a = "a long argument", 
                               b = "another argument",
                               c = "another long argument") {
  # As usual code is indented by two spaces.
}
```




## Use explicit returns {.smaller}

- Functions can return objects
- R has an implicit return feature
- Do not rely on this feature, but explicitly mention ``return(object)``

```r
# Good
AddValues <- function(x, y) {
  return(x + y)                     # Function returns x+y
}

# Bad
AddValues <- function(x, y) {
  x + y                             # Function still returns x+y
}                                   # but it is not immediate to see it
```




## Named arguments {.smaller}

- Often you can call a function without explicitly naming arguments:
  * ``plot(height, weight)``
  * ``mean(weight)``

- This might be fine for ``plot()`` or ``mean``

- However for less common functions:
  * One might struggle to remember the meaning of **arguments positions**
  * It is therefore good practice to **name arguments**

```r
# Good
seq(from = 1, to = 11, by = 1)

# Bad
seq(1, 11, 1)
```



## Comments {.smaller}

- **Most importantly**: Comment your code
- Each line of a comment should begin with comment symbol ``#`` and a single space

```r 
# Here we sum two numbers  
x+y
```


- Use commented lines of ``-`` and ``=`` to break up code into easily readable chunks

```r
# Load data ---------------------------

# Plot data ---------------------------
```
